# Insights — reviewer-core (`@devdigest/reviewer-core`)

Append-only log for `engineering-insights`. Add entries, never edit or delete
existing ones (append-only avoids merge conflicts). Once this file passes
~200 entries or a section gets crowded, split it into domain files (e.g.
`INSIGHTS-grounding.md`, `INSIGHTS-prompt.md`) and point to them from here.
Review monthly: prune stale entries (code since refactored/removed), merge
duplicates, and resolve any two entries that contradict each other — an
agent reading both will otherwise guess. This file is a session-wrap-up
draft, not verified truth: spot-check it periodically.
